# VideoToMP3

Command-line tool that downloads the audio from YouTube or other video links
and saves it as MP3. Built on [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), so it
works with YouTube and the many other sites yt-dlp supports (Vimeo, SoundCloud,
Dailymotion, Bandcamp, Twitch clips, and pages with common embedded players).

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- ffmpeg on your PATH
  - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
  - Windows: `winget install ffmpeg`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

```sh
# Single link
python3 video_to_mp3.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"

# Several links, 320 kbps, custom folder
python3 video_to_mp3.py URL1 URL2 -q 320 -o ~/Music/rips

# Links from a text file (one per line, # for comments)
python3 video_to_mp3.py -f links.txt

# Whole playlist
python3 video_to_mp3.py -p "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=LIST_ID"

# No arguments: prompts for a URL
python3 video_to_mp3.py
```

Options:

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `-o, --output DIR` | Output folder (default `./mp3_downloads`) |
| `-q, --quality N` | Bitrate: 96, 128, 160, 192, 256, 320 (default 192) |
| `-p, --playlist` | Download every item when the URL is a playlist |
| `-f, --file PATH` | Read URLs from a file |
| `--no-art` | Skip embedding the thumbnail as cover art |

Output files are named `Title [videoID].mp3` and include title/artist tags
and cover art.

## Troubleshooting

Sites change often. If downloads start failing, update yt-dlp first:
`pip install -U yt-dlp`.

## Legal

Only download content you own or have permission to download. YouTube's
Terms of Service prohibit downloading except where YouTube provides a
download option.
